title: About Me
---

I am a PhD candidate in the [Joint CMU -- University of Pittsburgh PhD Program in Computational Biology](https://www.compbio.cmu.edu/), where I work on AI/ML research for immunology in the [Das Lab](https://www.jishnulab.org/) at the [Center for Systems Immunology](https://www.immunology.pitt.edu/research/center-systems-immunology).

My research interests include **statistical modeling** and **deep learning** for noisy, high-dimensional biological signals. Currently, I am developing an interpretable variant of attention mechanisms for transformer models.

### Research Areas

- **Interpretable Machine Learning** -- Building transparent models that reveal biological mechanisms, not just predictions. My work on [SLIDE](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-024-02175-z) (Nature Methods) discovers latent factor interactions across biological domains.
- **Computational Immunology** -- Applying ML to multi-omic data (single-cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, systems serology) to understand immune responses in disease.
- **Deep Learning for Sequences** -- Developing attention-based architectures for biological sequence data with built-in interpretability.

### Education

- **PhD, Computational Biology** -- Carnegie Mellon University & University of Pittsburgh (in progress)
- Passed thesis proposal and doctoral candidate exam (October 2023)

### Selected Honors

- Research presentation award, University of Pittsburgh Immunology Retreat (2024)
- Quantitative Methodologies Pilot Program (QuMP) grant, co-PI (2023)

Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to share insights from my research journey in computational immunology and systems biology.

## Why I'm Starting This Blog

As researchers, we often focus on publishing papers and presenting at conferences, but there's so much that happens between those milestones. This blog will be a space to share:

- Interesting findings from ongoing projects
- Thoughts on new computational methods and tools
- Reflections on the research process
- Updates on collaborations and conferences

## What I'm Working On

Currently, I'm exploring how machine learning can help us better understand immune responses and disease mechanisms. My recent work has focused on:

1. **Multi-omic data integration** - Combining different types of biological data to get a more complete picture
2. **Interpretable ML models** - Making sure our models don't just predict, but also help us understand biology
3. **Single-cell analysis** - Understanding cellular heterogeneity in immune responses

## Looking Ahead

I'm looking forward to sharing more about these topics and connecting with others interested in computational biology, immunology, and data science.

Stay tuned for more posts!

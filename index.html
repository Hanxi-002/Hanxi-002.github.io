<br>I am a Research Scientist in the AI Speech team at <a href="https://research.facebook.com/">Meta AI</a>,
where I build robust on-device speech recognition models. My research interests lie in the application
of machine learning methods for speech and language tasks.<br><br>

Previously, I was a PhD student at <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>, working in the <a
	href="https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/">Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP)</a>, advised by <a
	href="https://clsp.wse.jhu.edu/faculty-pages/sanjeev/">Sanjeev Khudanpur</a> and <a
	href="http://www.danielpovey.com/">Dan Povey</a>. I was a JHU-Amazon AI2AI fellow, a Fred Jelinek fellow, and
an IEEE Rising Star in Signal Processing.<br><br>

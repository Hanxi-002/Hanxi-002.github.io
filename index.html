<!-- <br>I am a machine learning researcher focused on building models for biological sequence data. <br> -->
<br> I am a PhD candidate in the Joint Carnegie Mellon University- University of Pittsburgh PhD Program in Computational Biology, where I work on AI/ML research for immunology.<br>
<br> My research interests include statistical modeling and deep learning for noisy, high-dimentionsal signals. 
Currently, I am developing an interpretable variant of the attention mechanisms for transformer models.<br>

<!-- working in the <a href="https://www.immunology.pitt.edu/research/center-systems-immunology"> Center for Systems Immunolog, </a> advised by <a href="https://www.jishnulab.org/">Jishnu Das</a>. <br> -->

<br> I am a PhD candidate in the Joint CMU-Pitt PhD Program in Computational Biology, working in the <a href="https://www.immunology.pitt.edu/research/center-systems-immunology"> Center for Systems Immunolog, </a> advised by <a href="https://www.jishnulab.org/">Jishnu Das</a>. <br>
My research interest lie in interpretable machine learning, statistical modeling, and their applications in high-dimentionsal noisy sparse tabular data and large-scale high-dimensional sequence data.<br>
More specifically, my projects includes interpretable latent variable methods and interpretable attention mechanism. <br> <br>

Machine learning is a huge topic. It grows out of statistics, linear algebra, and optimization, and it often borrows intuition from areas like physics and information theory. On top of that, modern AI engineering moves fast. New terms show up constantly, like RAG, agents, tools, skills, and frameworks like LangChain. It is easy to learn things as isolated tricks and still feel lost.

This blog is built to fight that. Each post teaches one core idea in a clean, linear path, then adds small, skippable **Bridge** sections that link the idea to its closest neighbors right when the connection becomes useful. Those bridges are not filler. They are the mechanism that turns vocabulary into structure and helps patterns transfer across topics. Longer optional **Deep dive** sections hold full derivations or extra definitions, so the main narrative stays readable while still letting you go deep when you want.

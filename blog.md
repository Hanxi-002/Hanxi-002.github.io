Machine learning is a huge subject. It stems from statistics, linear algebra, and optimization, and it often borrows intuition from areas like physics and information theory. In 2025, NeurIPS had 21,575 submissions. It is easy to learn things as isolated tricks and still feel lost. Without deliberate concept linking, the field becomes a growing pile of definitions, acronyms, and one off recipes that is hard to navigate and even harder to retain.

This blog is built to fight that. Each post teaches one core idea in a clean, linear path, then adds small, skippable Bridge sections that link the idea to its closest neighbors right when the connection becomes useful. Those bridges are not filler. They are the mechanism that turns vocabulary into structure and helps patterns transfer across topics. Longer optional Deep dive sections hold full derivations or extra definitions, so the main narrative stays readable while still letting you go deep when you want.
